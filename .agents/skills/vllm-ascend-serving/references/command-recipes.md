# Agent call

From the repository root:

```text
python .agents/skills/vllm-ascend-serving/scripts/serving.py start --model /models/example --tp 1
```

Use serving.py status or serving.py stop with --execution-id or --service. A service reference is resolved by coordinator within the current task. Pending states retain their execution reference. Restart or release follows the requested lifecycle; no separate allocation, parity command or status ledger is needed.

Use `--help` for exact argument details. Report output directories are optional
where supported; the script creates a fresh directory under `.vaws-local/`.
Schema versions and report identifiers are generated internally. Input files
describe business cases or contain observed results, rather than task ownership.
