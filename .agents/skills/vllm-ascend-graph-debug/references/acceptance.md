# Maintainer verification

Run the affected tests in `../tests/` with the local test runner. Exercise the
public call with business inputs and actual result fixtures, including incomplete
or mismatched evidence. Verify that conclusions do not exceed the observed scope.
These checks belong to implementation maintenance, not a per-task Agent checklist.

Snapshot identity is read from sidecars, or --eager-identity and --graph-identity. The report compares observed identities and samples with finite tolerances, emits the first divergence and a comparability certificate, and retains missing identity as inconclusive. Its conclusion applies to the supplied snapshots.
